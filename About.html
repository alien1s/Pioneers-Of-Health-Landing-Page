              One of the most important medical services for ensuring our health

            <h2>Evolution of Radiology Services</h2>
            <p id="">
              In the early days of radiology, it was limited to hospitals with a
              limited number of devices, with a public service that was
              difficult to allocate to each individual.
            </p>
            <p id="">
              Over time, specialized centers emerged to provide patients with
              radiological examinations with better quality and comfort than
              before, but with incomplete solutions and a form that does not
              suit all times.
